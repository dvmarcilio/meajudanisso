# MeAjudaNisso

## About
  This is a question and answer application, heavily based on StackOverflow(http://www.stackoverflow.com).
  It was made as a college project, specifically as the final requirement to get a degree in Computer Science in Universidade Católica de Brasília (UCB), in Brazil. It was targeted to be used internally in the university, initially for students from IT.    
  
  The authors didn't have any prior experience with most of was used here: Ruby, Rails, TDD, BDD...

## TODOs
  
### Code
  Sure there is room for a lot of improvement. There might be ones that we don't even know about it. But the ones we know of are:  
* Redo how votes are being done. [StackOverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19591401/drying-up-rails-app-with-a-new-controller)
* Use partials
* Organize cucumber steps better. (perguntas_steps.rb has > 600 LOC)
